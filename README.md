# Teach Back

**ONLY APPLICABLE TO LEAD INSTRUCTOR APPLICANTS**

### Task
Pick any relevant basic programming topic (variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, p5 animation, CSS, DOM, etc.) and create a **3-5 minute** lesson. Lead Instructor applicants will mock-teach their lesson to the interviewers. 

### Rubric
- **PREPAREDNESS**
    - An ideal instructor's lesson plan is well-thought-out, organized, and polished.

- **LEARNING GOALS**
    - An ideal instructor is able to deliver a lesson with clear, concise, and realistic learning goals (achievable within 3-5 minutes). 

- **ENGAGEMENT**
    - An ideal instructor is able to engage student interest and encourage student participation. 
    
- **MODALITY**
    - An ideal instructor is able to incorporate multiple learning modes into a lesson (auditory, visual, kinesthetic).
    - For example, an instructor can verbalize how arrays work (auditory), while having students arrange themselves in a line as a way to simulate elements in an array (kinesthetic).

- **TIME MANAGEMENT**
    - An ideal instructor is able to adhere to the alloted **3-5 minutes** timeslot.

- **TECHNICAL PROFICIENCY**
    - Instructors will be asked questions commonly raised in the SI classroom. They should be able to answer these moderate questions appropriately.
    - Note: If you are asked a question you don't know the answer to, say so! Situations as such will happen when you teach, and it's alright to say "I don't know, ***yet***." 

- **ATTITUDE**
    - While this is an interview and we understand that interviews can be nerve-wrecking, **BE YOURSELF**! Have fun with your lesson plan. *Your students will only be passionate about your lesson if **YOU** are passionate teaching it~*
